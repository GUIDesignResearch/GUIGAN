## Dataset
Our data comes from Rico(from **[`Rico dataset`](http://interactionmining.org/rico)**), an open source mobile app dataset for building data-driven design applications. 

Through manual selection, we have collected relatively professional and more suitable apps for this study. The apps with more images, animation or game screens are not selected. In addition, the GUIs with large pop-up areas, Web links waiting, and full screen ads are not selected.

We try to test our modelâ€™s capability in capturing that characteristic by preparing separated dataset for five most frequent app categories in Rico dataset, including News & Magazines, Books & Reference, Shopping, Communication, and Travel & Local.
